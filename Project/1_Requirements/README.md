# Description
 * This Project is an Engineering Calculator and which is extremely useful to students and will save them time while doing some complex calculations   

## Identifying features
 * It should give accurate values
 * Having precision upto 6 decimal points
 * Easy to use

## State of art
 * The main focus point here is the precision which will be very useful for many sensitive calculation
 * Takes less computational time

## Requirements

<!-- Tables -->

| ID | High Level Requirements |
| -------- | -------------- |
| HL1 | Options for Different operations |
| HL2 | Take different inputs for Different options |
| HL3 | Store Data inserted |
| HL4 | Calculate the Different operations |


| ID | Low Level Requirements for HL1|       |ID | Low Level Requirements for HL2|
| -------- | -------------- | ---- |-------- | -------------- |
| H1L1 | Give all the options available|       |H2L1 | Get the input Option |
| H1L2 | Give all the Sub-options available|       |H2L2 | Get the variable values according to Selected option |



| ID | Low Level Requirements for HL3|  |ID | Low Level Requirements for HL4|
| -------- | -------------- | ---- | -------- | -------------- |
| H3L1 | Set the initial Database to Zero |  | H4L1 | Calculate the equation according to input data |
| H3L2 | Store Data inserted data into the Database |  | H4L2 | Print the final result to the screen |

## Best Method Followed
 * Instead of making multiple loops for sorting here we have used qsort which is the best method to follow and it gives best results
