# Description
 * This Project is an __Automatic Burglar alert, Cooling, Lighting and Drapes Control system__, _ABCLDS_ which will be usefull for automatic light controlling in home and when we are not in home we can activate Buglar alarm which will give a sound noise alerting people around the home by buzzing noise when someone brakes the Door

## Identifying features
 * It should show how much %of drapes should be opened according to room light intensity
 * It should dim light intensity according to room light intensity
 * It should change the speed of fan accordingly to the temperature of the room
 * When we are not at home it should be able to sense if door is closed or broken and should turn on a buzzer

## State of art
 * The main focus point here is the controlling the Home without even touching a single button
 * And also securing our home with a reliable __Burglar system__
 * Now this two features are combined and made into one product i.e. __ABCLDS__

## Best Method Followed
 * Instead of making multiple loops for sorting here we have used qsort which is the best method to follow and it gives best results
