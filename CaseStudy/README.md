## Now letâ€™s explore each component
## LCD Display
*	This displays the timer value and the temperature of the oven and also which option is selected i.e. Baking /Cooking.
## Buttons
*	Buttons helps us to select the timer value and Mode of cooking 
## Sensor (Safety Lock)
*	This Safety lock sensor gives data to Micro Controller weather door is locked on not
## Actuator (Safety Lock)
*	This Actuator locks the door of Micro Oven when in use
## Motor Driver
*	This is used to drive the motor (Actuator)
## Actuator (Motor)
*	This motor will rotate to cook food evenly (Will be situated at base plate)
## Clock
*	This is used to synchronize the Micro controller and most of the times it is usually located inside Micro controller
## Sensor (Temperature)
*	This sensor gives temperature values to Micro controller
## EEPROM
*	This is a memory here in this EEPROM we will have Both Nand and Nor which will basically store Data and Program memory respectively
## Micro Controller
*	This is the brain of our system This will tell us when to lock when to unlock
and defines timer and sends control signals to high voltage control unit 
## Relays and High Voltage AC Control Unit 
*	This system consists of relays and Transformer which are controlled by the micro controller
## Magnetron and Heater
*	If user selects option for Baking Heater will get activated if user selects for Cooking Magnetron will get activated, which are best options for Baking and Cooking respectively.
